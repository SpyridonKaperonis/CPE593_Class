# Hardware Accelerated Sorting

Implement an algorithm in FPGA using a simulation environment to test concepts in advanced high-performance vector stream processing. If you are interested in this project see me for details.

This project is unpublished work, and I would expect your report to be a preliminary towards publication, which you could join.

Here is an example of [GPU accelerated sorting](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems2/part-vi-simulation-and-numerical-algorithms/chapter-46-improved-gpu-sorting)
