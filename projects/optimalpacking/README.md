# Optimal Packing

Given a container and a set of objects, there is a group of problems called the knapsack or rucksack problems in computer science that involve finding the optimal packing. For the simple backpack, the problem is abstracted as a number, and the goal is to try to fill the backpack to its capacity. For a real physical box in 2D, the problem is more complicated because the objects have to fit inside and there can be wasted space.

There are basically 4 options for this project, listed here in order of increasing difficulty.

* 2d box with L,W, and 2d rectangular objects with size Li,Wi, design an algorithm to find the optimal packing
* 3d box with L,W,H and 3d objects with Li,Wi,Hi (same thing as above but 3d).
* 2d box but the objects are not rectangular and therefore can be fit together better or worse.
* 3d box, again with objects that are not rectilinear and therefore can be packed much better or worse.
