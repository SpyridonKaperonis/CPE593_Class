# Punctuation Dictionary

This project is similar to dictionary compression. However, instead of filtering out project Gutenberg books, and focusing on the words, focus on the punctuation. Build a dictionary of the patterns of punctuation in sentences.

For example, the following lines each have one sentence. Your job is to collect punctuation into a dictionary, for future use. Each punctuation is encoded after the ordinal position in the sentence. The idea is to create a dictionary recording all punctuation across a set of books and how many of each occur.

Sentence | Punctuation
--- | ---
This is a short sentence. | 5.
This, I believe, is a test. | 1,3,6.
What kinds of punctuation are there? | 6?
She said, "I believe you are mad." | 2,"7."
