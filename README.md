# CPE 593

The documentation for this course is being moved into markdown in this repo.
However, since it's a work in progress, for the interim, here is the link to the old directory on google drive:

[old course directory is here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwxfq4Y7f7vkeHB2emExaThFUlE?resourcekey=0-vc7jfyiAfUHaAAc1ZPX5rw&usp=share_link)

Specifically
* Old syllabus information for all courses is in courseinfo
* Resume information is in jobplacement (see the examples in particular)
* There are course videos for all my courses, so if you need to prep on something specific in C++ you can find it

All the new documents are markdown.
* [New syllabus](syllabus.md)
* [reference directory with papers](ref)
* [under that, free books](ref/books)
* [setting up for my courses in C++ or Java](https://github.com/stevensdeptece/DovKrugerCourses)
